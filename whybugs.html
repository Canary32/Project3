        <p>Aside from the bragging rights of saying you eat bugs, they have also been proven 
        to be nutritious and cost friendly. Insects are generally rich in vitamins like 
        iron and zinc, as well as essential fatty acids like Omega-3. They're also low in
         fat and a good source of protein. Insects are also a very bio-available food 
         source. Many people are surprised by how good insects taste; and that insects 
         come in such a wide variety of flavors! Crickets for instance are widely 
         described to be "nutty" flavor! </p>
        <h6>A 100-gramme portion of crickets can contain as much as 69 grammes of protein!</h6>
